# Exercise 4 - Running the apache-basic-playbook

Congratulations!  You just wrote a playbook that incorporates some key Ansible concepts that you will use in most, if not all, of your future playbooks.  Before you get too excited though, we should probably make sure it actually runs.

So, lets do that now.

## Section 1 - Running your new apache playbook

### Step 1:
Make sure you are in the right directory and create a host file.

```bash
cd ~/apache-basic-playbook
```

### Step 2:
Run your playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

## Section 2: Review

If successful, you should see standard output that looks very similar to the following.  If not, just let us know.  We'll help get things fixed up.
